#Modules in Python : Modules in Python are either pre-built toolboxes, or toolboxes 
#we build ourselves and import into projects that need them

#Modules typically contain functions, varibles, and classes

#Why?

#-- Efficiency: why build something, that already exists
#-- Organization: Keeping things tidy and separating your concerns into their 
#own designated spots
#-- Reusability: Recycling your tools.
